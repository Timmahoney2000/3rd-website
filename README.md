# CISY 225 Spring 2019 Project 2 
# Add images to About Me page as figures with captions

You are going to have to clone the files from Project 2 into this repo. Once you do that, you are going to take 3 photos that make up a conherent theme and add them to your images folder. Then you'll edit index.html and styles.css to make the required changes. 

You are expected to read chapter 4 of your text as preparation for this assignment. Also you must use our CSS formatting rules from the CISY 225 Style Guide.

1. Download the clone of your completed Project 1 repo.
2. Make sure that the old Project 2 README.md file does not overwrite this one. 
3. Upload the rest of the files into this repo to make your starter code. 
4. Decide on your theme and go out and take some photos.
5. Edit three of your best photos and resize the pictures to fit best on a mobile screen. Make the width of the picture 640px.
6. Save the edited pictures with a filename that includes "-small" in the filename.
7. Make sure you save the original pictures.
8. Copy the -small pictures into the images folder.
9. In your index.html file make a new html5 section below the "about-me" section but before the footer.
10. Insert three figures using the proper html5 tags.
11. Add a figure caption for each picture. 
12. The CSS for each image should make the image have a max-width of 100%. 
13. Put two horizontal rules between the three images.
