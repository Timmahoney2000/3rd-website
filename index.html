                    <p class="my-info">I'd like to spend some time working at a small start up and help them build their brand name through a well designed site then move on to large company to manage a team of developers where we work with cutting edge tech.
                    
                    I have worked with computers for over 20 years in hardware testing, system building, sales, & quality assurance.
                    
                    Most recently I've been a chef at high end, farm-to-table restaurants and have worked in corporate events planning menus for executive parties. After returning to college I am working towards a degree in computer programming so that I can return to the tech industry.
